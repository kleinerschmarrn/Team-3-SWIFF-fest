            <h2> Lloyds Amphitheatre </h2>
            <br>
              <p>A distinctive Bristol harbourside landmark, the Amphitheatre was built by Lloyds bank around Canon House, the former regional headquarters of the bank in Bristol. A striking example of post modernist architecture, the Grade II building it sorrounds draws local inspiration, referencing the crescents of Georgian Bristol and nearby Bath, featuring bold geometric forms and features of classical architecture. Canon House played an important role in the post-industrial regeneration of Bristol’s docks as a thriving recreation and cultural centre. The Ampitheatre continues to  maintain this accolade today hosting some of the city's biggest events.  </p>

        <br>
        <p> Nestled amongst Bristol's harbourside and Old City, the final location is a magnificent and spacious Georgian square lined with trees, sorrounded by cobbled streets and with a history matched by its beauty.

    <h2> Brunel's SS Great Britain</h2>
      <br>
      <p> Viewings aboard the ship that changed the world. A multi-award winning  attraction, the infamous steam ship was rescued from wreckage in 1970 and restored to her Victorian glamour. Highly advanced for her time, she was designed by honorary Bristolian and genius engineer Isambard Kingdom Brunel and was the first Iron steamer to cross the Atlantic. Now at home in Bristol's dry dock, she provides a magical and transportive venue for events today. </p>
